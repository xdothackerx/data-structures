<h4>Project Title: Data Structures</h4>
<h5>Author: Sam Camus (xdothackerx) </h5>

This repo holds sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Ruby. All come with tests to demonstrate their properties. Included in this project (in order of implementation) are:

  - Linked list, including traversal and adding/removing nodes. The linked list in this version takes the form of a scavenger or treasure hunt.

  - Stack, with push and pop functions. My version mimicks a buffet plate dispenser.

  - Queue, in the form of a single file line.

  - Binary tree, made up of managers and employees.

  - Several kinds of sort algorithms
    Included are:
    - insertion sort
    - merge sort
    - quick sort

  - Hash map

  - Binary search tree, including four modes of traversal
